What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need todo it?
git creates a hidden folder. I need to do this so git knows what folders to manage.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a intermediary space where we can put the files that we wish to commit. It helps organize our work.
