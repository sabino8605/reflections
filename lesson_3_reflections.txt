Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy os a project only on github. We do it to create a repository where we can make changes.
Clone is a copy os a repository in github to our computer. We do it so we can work on it.
Branch is a change on a local repository. We do it if we want to try something new but still maintain our original version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work with, or see the differences between the last known state and your working copy.
